description: optimizes ways to divide a single part into multiple for reducing time and cost of high-value parts

---
High-value materials may be particularly difficult to machine and one may release siginificant cost and time saving by dividing a part into small pieces that are joined
together. The permutations for such divisions is endless, yet an advanced AI algorithm
developed over four years of industry funding has lead to a robust solution. Imagine how
such an analysis could be used to reduce your product's cost while sacrficing nothing.
