                    <p>Part Analyzer is an easy to use platform that gives you quick estimates for part costs and timings. As a platform, it triggers 
                        simulations that run based purely on part geometry files and materials. </p>
                        <p>In this beta release four simulations are provided:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Standard Stock Machining: </b>find the best stock shape for your part, produce a rough machining plan (with detailed 
                                steps on orientations, roughing, peripheral, and finishing, etc), and get estimate for the time and cost.</li>
                            <li><b>Part Divider: </b>When is it better to make a metal part from one piece of stock or multiple pieces? This optimization fits stock-sizes to portions of your 
                                designed shape while including details on joining costs. Compare and constrast a dozen plans to find new ways to make your parts better, cheaper and quicker.</li>
                            <li><b>Closed Die-Forging Shape Estimator: </b>A quick simulation finds the best orientation for creating your part from a closed-die forged blank. An approximation
                                of the forged shape will inform your design team on how changes may be made to fit the part's form to its demanding function.</li>
                                <li><b>Hybrid Substrate Optimization: </b>Metal 3D printing is becoming a viable option in certain situations. In this optimization, we will find where best
                                    place the base plate to minimize both additive and subtractive processes.</li>
