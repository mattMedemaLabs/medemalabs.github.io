description: a tradeoff analysis of how parts may be created with less time and cost at the expense of small amount of added mass

---
By searching over numerous machining directions, this simulation identifies a pareto plot of several designs where each represents how a small amount of added mass can drastically reduce costs. In these examples, the magenta material represents this added
mass, which is found by subtractively removing material from the stock shapes. This is 
particularly useful when starting with topology optimized parts that are defined with
little regard for subtractive manufacturing.

Combined with Part Divider, the process provides further intuition into how a small change in a part can greatly reduce part cost. Consider the following part

where the division into the green and gold parts indicates that a simplification (i.e.
removal of bosses) can lead to a suitable and low-cost solution.
