description: Working only with a 3D representation of a part, this module quickly determines the best stock material type/size for the part, as well as, a base-line prediction of the total time and cost to create the part. 

The stock types considered include: plate (with discrete sizes), rectangular and circular bar, closed-die forgings, and wire or powder for additive manufacturing. The processes considered include: CNC machining, waterjet, and directed energy deposition (DED).
