description: Estimating forging volumes are time-consuming and require years of expertise in forging processes to make accurate predictions. This module quickly finds the best orientation and flat parting line, and then adds tolerance offsets and draft to get a forging volume estimate. From this forging volume, the estimated time and cost (including post-machining) is calculated so that an engineering designer can get quick feedback on the design.
