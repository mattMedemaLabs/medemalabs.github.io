description: Acting in the opposite direction of Part Divider, this approach performs a search over parts in an assembly that are rigidly attached to identify which ones can be combined to reduce time and cost.

Additive manufacturing provides many new avenues for redesigning and improving existing
systems. The Parts Consolidator can help engineers find combinations of components that
may be combined - usually in a new additive part - to reduce part count and thus reduce
cost and time for manufacturing.
